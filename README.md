# UFOs
## Overview
THe purpose of this project is to create webpage that allows users to search through UFO sightings data by data, city, state, country, and shape, and to view it in a table format.

Software/tools used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript

## Results
### Webpage:
The webpage has been deployed at: [https://lexyzhong.github.io/UFOs/](https://lexyzhong.github.io/UFOs/)

### To filter your search results:
1) Access the webpage.
2) In the "Filter Search" box in the left-hand side of the page, enter a valid text-option in each of the available input boxes. If an incorrect input is received or the variable being searched does not exist in the original dataset, an empty table will result. Should this occur, please try again with corrected/new filter inputs.
3) To view the entire datasets without filters, click on the "UFO Sightings" hyperlink in the top-left corner of the webpage header to return to be re-directed.

## Summary
Please note that the dataset used to populate the tables currently only draws from only US sources. This presents as a potential drawnback, limiting usage. As such, one recommendation for further development would be to expand that dataset by updating the data.js file to include more US and worldwide UFO sightings data. Additional formating could also be done in CSS to improve the webpage user interface and make it more aethetically pleasing or user friendly.
